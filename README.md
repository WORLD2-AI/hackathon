## 🧠 What is This Project?

**virtual world** is a fully AI-driven virtual game world. Here, intelligent agents interact, grow, and build an ever-evolving civilization. Our goal is to create a new form of digital life—**where your memory and personality can live forever**.

This project **introduces for the first time**:

- 🧬 **True Intelligence (TI)**: a new paradigm beyond reactive AI—self-growing, reflective, and persistent.  
- 🌐 **Knowledge Graph Integration**: enabling explainable, structured, and evolving AI knowledge.  
- ♻️ **Digital Immortality**: AI agents remember, plan, and develop long-term identity and emotional context.  
- 🎮 **Virtual Game as Carrier**: explore, co-create, and witness the rise of a synthetic society.
