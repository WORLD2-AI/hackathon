# 🌐virtual world: Digital Immortality Engine

## Overview

Digital Immortality Engine is a persistent virtual game world powered by AI agents capable of memory, planning, and long-term evolution. Our vision is to realize Digital Immortality and lay the foundation for True Intelligence (TI).

We are the first to explore:

🧬 TI: beyond reactive models

🌐 Knowledge Graphs: structured, explainable knowledge

♻️ Digital Immortality: agents that grow, reflect, and persist

🎮 Virtual Game as interactive container

## Progress

✅ Multi-agent simulation & memory

✅ MCP-based interaction

🔄 RAG + KG backend (in progress)

🧪 TI prototype experiments

## Smart Contract
